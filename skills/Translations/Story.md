Flamecraft Digital Stories
PROLOGUE

Introduction of who we are and that we have come to the town to help build the first lighthouse in the town. Its purpose is to show the way to the town to dragons from further lands, so that they can share their craft with people. 
You keep the letter folded in your pocket, though the ink is smudged and the edges are gently singed. It serves as a reminder of who you were before coming to town and meeting such wonderful new friends.
“Welcome Flamekeeper! We are delighted that you have agreed to make your way to our quaint little town on such short notice. The artisan dragons have been very excited to begin this grand project, but it has been quite difficult sorting out what that even is without a translator. They are eager to start immediately, and we are not sure what they intend to do with all this wood, stone and sheep.”
You couldn’t imagine, as you approached the quiet little town, that “translator” meant mediator, snack holder, safety inspector, and occasional test subject. You certainly hadn’t known you would be forever changed by their boundless energy and their warm, wonderful hearts.
It all started when one fancy dragon named Twinkle said, “We need a way for our friends to find us?”
The others chimed in, talking all over each other as is their way, “What about travelers? Adventurers? Merchants? Cuddly Critters? Everyone needs a light in the dark.”
“We should build a tower,” grumbled Flint, in his gravelly way.
“With a beacon!” chimed Frostfire, a name I would soon come to know well.
“Tall enough to tickle the clouds!” added Blossom with a mischievous giggle. 
Looking around at the village—at smoke-weathered chefs working beside flaming grill masters, at tiny tea stained paws helping quench hard working farmers, at children braiding flowers through leaf scaled tails—you finally realize what the dragons knew all along. Everyone should have a chance to meet such fantastic friends and be able to enjoy their wonderful world.

ACHIEVEMENT 1
We ask dragons and residents for opinions, and together you decide on the place where the lighthouse is to stand.
This may work best as the First story revealed, I’m not sure it works in the middle of all the rest of them where they are already building things.

You stand in the town park, surrounded by villagers and a hoard of dragons, wondering if you made a mistake. Asking for help finding a location for the tower has led to fantastical suggestions such as—on a cloud, underwater, or miniaturized on a table at Flagons & Dragons.
“Remember, this will be a beacon to help new friends find us,” you plead. 
“Build it over the smokehouse!” shouts a stout red dragon. “Everyone knows that smoked beacon tastes better!”
You rub your temples and decide to call it a day, when a quiet yellow dragon clears their throat.
“What if,” Loaf trilled softly, “we build it here? The park is already where we all gather.”
You smile approvingly. “Even the smallest voice can spark the brightest flame.”


ACHIEVEMENT 2
Bread dragons have prepared magical pastries for the lighthouse builders.  Enchanted bread gives builders a lot of energy and mental fortitude.

The scent of fresh baked bread fills the street as three yellow dragons dance around a cart piled high with baskets of warm loaves. You recognize Suzette as she happily rushes to greet you.
“Flamekeeper! These Lightning Loaves will give us all the energy we need to work on the tower, but the enchantment is incomplete without a Keeper to call the thunder,” she chirped.
Your eyes widen in shock, and she quietly adds, “Just a little thunder?”
You smile and ask the dragons to focus their flames together. As you chant, the buns spark and ignite in a flash. The smell of honey and rain assault your senses as a low rumble causes the dragons to stare at you.
Rubbing your belly, you chuckle and say,  “Can I get the first loaf?”
ACHIEVEMENT 3
Plant dragons use their magic to grow sturdy, enchanted vines, which they plan to use to strengthen the lighthouse structure.

The note on the bouquet of beautiful flowers asked you to meet at the Hedges & Henges greenhouse. You were not expecting the massive vines towering out of the roof, nor being immediately tackled by a crop of muddy plant dragons.
“Thankfully Thistle isn’t here or I’d be quite prickly,” you joke, but in their excitement they don’t even notice.
Blossom blushes and flowers bloom across her body, “We did it! We figured out how to strengthen the tower with enchanted vines!” she squawked.
“It’s very sturdy, organic and delicious!” purred Lotus. 
“Only slightly chewed,” Mulch mumbled.
Looking up at the strong braided vines you are impressed, and a bit scared, at the tremendous skills of these generous green goofballs.
ACHIEVEMENT 4
Fancy dragons are planning the grand opening party. They want to make huge explosions and seem unaware that it could be problematic.

Understanding dragons is one thing, but how you end up negotiating fire safety with three glitter-dusted disasters, is quite another.
“Picture it: the tower opens with explosions of color in the sky!” squeaks Dazzle.
Frazzle spins, exhaling a lightshow of cute kittens (kowls?) bursting into sparkles. “But not real critters,” she chirps.
Starburst nods eagerly adding, “But definitely real fireworks. An excessively enthusiastic amount!”
“Explosions are dangerous, something could catch fire,” you remind them.
They blink in unison.
“But fire doesn’t hurt, silly,” Frazzle coos gently.
Starburst pats your knee, as if you are slow. “Relax, Flamekeeper. We promise the only thing we’ll blow… is people’s minds.”
ACHIEVEMENT 5
Crystal dragons, with the help of fancy dragons, develop a special crystal structure adapted to the lighthouse.


After a long day spent bartering with stingy salesmen in Dragon Alley, you head home to get some sleep. Just as you exit the alley a column of bright light illuminates the night sky. Rushing to see what occurred, you find Moonbeam and Sparkle stumbling out of the Cosmic Scale observatory. 

“What’s with the light show?” you ask. 

“I can’t see, did it work!” screeched Sparkle.

“Why are you shouting? I’m right next to you!” hissed Moonbeam. “The hi-beam enchantment must have worked! Can you see the moon, FlameKeeper?”

Squinting up past the light, you find the moon and can just make out the word “hi” twinkling on its surface. Hopefully the enchantment, and the blindness, are not permanent.

ACHIEVEMENT 6
All dragons gather in <Crystal Dragon's Name>'s shop to transfer some of their power to a special artifact.  They want to imbue the lighthouse crystal with it.

Candles light the way as you squeeze into the Eternal Flame where the other dragons have already gathered.
“Welcome,” Frostfire chimes, “these runes will light our beacon, but without flame from each of us—and our Flamekeeper—the luminosity will fade.”
You kneel in the center of the runes. You can hear them all—excited, proud, slightly snack-distracted.
“On three,” Frostfire instructs.
“One,” snorts Flint.
“Two,” whispers Loaf.
“Pause for dramatic effect,” adds Starburst.
You suppress a chuckle and say, “Three,” releasing the enchantment to bind these dragons to the runes of their ancestors.
Flames flare around you, but you feel no heat. The runes blaze—then settle into a steady, hopeful glow.
ACHIEVEMENT 7
I went in a different direction, mostly because it reflects the Iron dragon’s ability to build things more than just a metal mixture. I also thought it was pretty funny, but you can let me know.


You have seen many strange things as a FlameKeeper, but nothing like the contraption in front of you. An iron dragon stares intently at a platform on two tightly wound springs, and breathes a gout of fire in frustration. 

“Hello Flint, is everything good?” you ask.

Without turning, he grumbles, “Ach, I am tryin’ to make a lift ta bring anyone ta tha top of the tower.”

“Maybe a levitation enchantment?” you think out loud.

“Goin’ up is easy, stoppin’ is tha issue. The last test sent tha poor blacksmith flying inta tha river!” Flint growls, motioning for you to step up.

Your face turns as white as a crystal dragon’s belly, until Flint bursts out into laughter, “HAH! Just kiddin’! I just realized I left me lunch is all.”

ACHIEVEMENT 8
Crystal dragons examine a mysterious crystal found on the edge of the forest.  In their presence, dragon magic becomes stronger.  They think about using it as a beacon for the lighthouse.

You hit the mossy ground hard, ears ringing, vision sparkling like shattered glass.
“Oh dear,” chimed Frostfire, “the gem’s crystalline structure clearly amplified my tiny test flame. I should have adjusted for resonance.”
“Right…” drawls Deathfang. “Clearly if you find a mysterious glowing stone surrounded by ancient warning symbols, the obvious plan is ‘tiny experimental flame.’ Flawless plan.”
You groan. “I can taste the color purple.”
Frostfire huffs, “A minor setback. I’m certain I can regulate the output to make a splendid beacon for the tower.”
Deathfang grins at you. “Translation: we will be bringing the migraine mineral home to play with.’”
The gem seems to hum louder in amusement.

ACHIEVEMENT 9
Potion dragons prepare potions of strength and endurance, which give builders an extra boost for the quick building of the lighthouse.  In addition, they have no preservatives and taste like watermelon.


As you are strolling through the park, you swear you see a large purple fin peeking out over the top of some trees. As you approach, you are stunned to see a twenty foot tall potion dragon that looks utterly confused as two others argue over a cauldron.

“The recipe said Dragon-well, not Dragon-swell leaf!” Elderberry bubbled.

“You’re the one that added the Humongous Fungus,” Lavender huffed indignantly.

The dragons cease bickering when they see you and both point at the enlarged dragon exclaiming, “It’s Venti’s fault!”

Venti grins and stands, accidentally uprooting a tree with her tail, then roars, “I’m an elder dragon. Rawwr!”

You want to explain what Potion of Giant Strength means, but this could be useful. 

ACHIEVEMENT 10
All shopkeepers contribute to a fundraiser for the purchase of materials for the building of the lighthouse.  A considerable sum is collected.

After much pressure from the dragons, you set up a fundraising day at the Bizarre Bazaar. The park quickly fills as villagers and dragons come together and you worry it might all be too much.
Cookie carefully crafts her tasty treats and Jasmine brews her famously fizzy royal tea. Rainbow patiently paints gaggles of giggling children while Herb weaves wreaths for all to wear. Silverscale and Cole collect coins by the Wishing well, offering well wishes to everyone for their kindness.
Even Flambe’s friendly farm is a hit, until the glogoats get a whiff of what’s cooking.
Glogoats riot, children squeal in delight and fun is had by all.
By sunset, the coin jars are full and you know this was the right choice after all.

ACHIEVEMENT 11
The meat dragons prepared a great feast for all residents of the town every evening.  They bustled all day, only to then, by the light of the campfire and music played by the local band, have fun and unite in common efforts.


Hot Dog was dog tired. He, Cutlet and Skewart had been cooking since the ground breaking ceremony began. Everything was a blur, but when there are hungry folk around, a meat dragon is always happy to cook.

As you arrive for your third helping of Displacer Beef, you notice them stewing.

“What’s wrong? You’re doing great and the food is delicious,” you say, wiping sauce off your cheek.

“It’s just that we came to party, not work. The mayor said we should meet everyone, not MEAT everyone!” barked Hot Dog.

Cutlet sighs, smoke drifting sadly from her nostrils, “I just wanted to cut a rug, not a loin.”
Realizing what is wrong, you lean down and say to your little red buddies, “Go chill and let me keep the grill fired up.”
EPILOGUE
All dragons gather in the square.  The entire lighthouse structure has already been prepared by all types of dragons.  Only the crystal remains to be inserted.  Crystal dragons approach with the crystal wrapped in cloth.  They carry it up the stairs to the very top of the lighthouse and then place it in the designated mechanism.  They uncover the crystal, which blinds everyone with its unearthly glow.  Everyone cheers.  From afar, dragons from outside the town spot the lighthouse's gleam.

The entire village gathers in the park beneath the finished tower. It rises above you—braided vines, fitted iron gears, rune carved stone—all built by hard working villagers and tiny determined flames.
Dragons chitter, perched along the railings and shoulders of their friends and found family. Flames flicker amongst them as they buzz with excitement and pride.
You hesitate, as you did when you first arrived at this village. You barely remember why you were so nervous and unsure. These people, and certainly these dragons, always knew that you were the right person for this task.
“This tower was just a thought,” you begin, “a Twinkle in a dragon’s eye, if you’ll permit the pun.” The crowd groans lovingly as a shower of twinkling lights rain down from the fancy dragon at your side. “It was a simple idea, but as it grew it became a promise. No one who looks for us will ever be lost.”
“Except maybe the glogoats,” muttered Flambe.
“Or tha poor blacksmith,” Flint chuckled.
You can’t help but wince as an excessive amount of fireworks explode around you. The entranced crowd parts as Starburst leads the way, soaking in the spectacle. Frostfire nervously walks beside the beacon, making sure it remains safe as many other dragons escort the cart. You join them on Flint’s elevation machine and hold your breath as you pull the lever.
The mechanism hums and gears turn smoothly lifting you all safely to the top of the tower. You and Frostfire exhale simultaneously and stare at each other knowingly.
“Ready?” you ask, guiding the beacon over to its iron settings.
“Pause for dramatic effect,” sings Starburst from behind you.
The beacon locks into place. The runes pulse in response. The cloth falls away.
Light erupts into the night sky and for a heartbeat, everyone is silent.
Then cheers shake the tower.
Far beyond the hills, distant dragons lift their heads. In the beam they see a sparkling rune.
In the ancient tongue of the elder dragons, one word repeats:
“Friends.”

POEMS
I wrote these poems way back in the day, not sure you ever got them or not.
SOCIAL MEDIA
A dragon’s work is never done,
gifting goods and having fun.
They love to build and bake and boil,
and sear and shine and till the soil.
Yet even when they rest their flames,
They’re crafting ways to play more games.
RELEASE
There were some dragons with a dream,
to turn their flame into some steam.
Converting magic to a screen,
is more complex than it would seem.
They worked so hard to get things right,
So all could craft from day till night.
